# PaintDaWish

I developed this project during my programming bootcamp. For a week (mainly after classes), I dived into the fundamentals of software development, explored various programming concepts and was introduced to the world of Graphical User Interfaces

Map Editor is a straightforward application inspired by Paint, designed to create and modify a grid using basic graphical tools. Utilising Code for All_'s library, "Simple Graphics GFX," I implemented features such as drawing shapes, saving/loading and selecting colours to customise the grid according to user preferences.

Overall, Map Editor served as a practical exercise in applying programming concepts learnt during the first weeks of the bootcamp and reinforced my understanding of software development fundamentals.

Controls:

Space bar - paint and erase;  
C - clear grid;  
S - save;  
L - Load;  
1-9 - change colour;
